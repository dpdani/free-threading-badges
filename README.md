### Usage

If your project supports the experimental free-threading build of Python, put this in your Markdown file:
```md
[![supports free-threading](https://github.com/dpdani/free-threading-badges/raw/main/supported.svg)](https://py-free-threading.github.io/)
```

If you want to make it clear that your package does not support free-threading at the moment, put this instead:
```md
[![does not support free-threading](https://github.com/dpdani/free-threading-badges/raw/main/not-supported.svg)](https://py-free-threading.github.io/)
```
